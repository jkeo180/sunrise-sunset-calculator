# sunrise-sunset-calculator
I made this in python it has taught me a lot about using libraries,Date and Time Handling managing dates, times, and converting between different time zones (UTC to local time).
Using Modular Programming: How to break down sunset calculations into smaller more managable functions(calculating the day of the year)
Error Handling: I learned much about this with things like locations where the sun may not rise or set on a given day (polar regions).
Using Libraries: Using dedicated libraries like suntime or astropy simplified the development process by providing pre-built functions for sunset calculations, saving me from implementing complex astronomical algorithms. As of 7/11/2025 It's not 100% but about 80% will continue polishing it up and give updates in the readme file
